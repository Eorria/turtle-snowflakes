## Challenge: Every snowflake is different

- Can you uncomment the random colour instruction and place it in the function, so that each branch has a different colour?
- Can you create a snowflake function and then repeat it all over the window?
- Can you have many snowflakes of different colours and different sizes, like those in [Make snowflakes with code by Carrie Anne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHmeX7YTHBY)?
