## How to turn with Python Turtle

Your turtle is pointing in one direction, which is good news if you want to draw a line, but it is time to think about drawing a shape like a square!

- Underneath the line `elsa.forward(100)` in your Python code, add:

  ```python
  elsa.right(90)
  ```
  
  *Note: Turtle uses angles in degrees. There are 360 degrees in a circle. How many are in the right angle of a square? That's right: 90. The value 90 inside the brackets in `elsa.right(90)` is in degrees. So this line is telling your turtle to turn right by 90 degrees.*
  
- Add another instruction underneath to move your turtle forward by 100:   

  ```python
  elsa.forward(100)
  ```
  
- Save and run your code to see what happens.

- You are on your way to creating a square. What do you need to add to your code in order to complete the square?
