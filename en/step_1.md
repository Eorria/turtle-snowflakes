## What you will make
Create a beautiful landscape of snowflakes using Python Turtle. This is great fun and a great way to start learning how to code with Python. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, use loops to repeat a sequence, use the `random` module, and how to use functions.

## What you will learn
By making snowflakes with code on your Raspberry Pi you will learn:
 
- How to draw lines with Python Turtle
- How to make turns
- To use loops to repeat some instructions and create shapes
- To use more loops to create spiral patterns
- How to change the pen colour randomly
- How to create a function to draw a snowflake
